# Profile Contract (version 1)

`@nuxt4-layers/profile/contracts` is the only supported import path for this capability's types and pure helpers. It imports nothing but `zod`: no driver, key service or other capability's package.

Profile answers two questions: **what describes this person**, and **what may this viewer see of it, now?** It is the only canonical source of the personal data that describes a person. Authentication never stores or seeds it ([IAM architecture](https://github.com/nuxt4-layers/iam-integration/blob/f2dcec8afd27bec5f0a40d73e652dc4644d6ad4c/docs/architecture.md) §1).

## 1. Boundaries

| Concern | Owner | How Profile sees it |
|---|---|---|
| Names, contact details and preferences that describe a person | **Profile** | Its own schema, encrypted per person (§6) |
| Who may see each attribute | **Profile**, under the person's control | Disclosure settings (§4) |
| Identities, groups, tenants, memberships, a person's standing | Identity | The disclosure-context port and Identity's events, adapted by the host |
| Sign-in identifiers, credentials, sessions | Authentication | Never: a contact email here is independent of a sign-in email there |
| Domain records | Domain capabilities | They store Identity's identifiers and ask Profile for names |

## 2. Keys

Every record is keyed by Identity's identifier (a UUIDv7), never derived from personal data. Only identities of kind `person` have a record. A record is created, empty, when Identity announces `identity.provisioned`, or when the person first saves something if that event has not arrived yet.

## 3. The record

The attributes are named as OpenID Connect standard claims:

| Attribute | Rule |
|---|---|
| `name`, `given_name`, `family_name` | Safe names: Unicode NFC, spaces collapsed, no control, format or private-use characters, one script or an allowed combination, 1 to 200 code points |
| `preferred_username` | A safe name of up to 64 code points |
| `locale` | A BCP 47 tag, e.g. `en-GB` |
| `zoneinfo` | An IANA time zone, e.g. `Europe/London` |
| `email` | An email address, with `email_verified` |
| `phone_number` | E.164, e.g. `+447700900123`, with `phone_number_verified` |

Contact details are stored unverified, and become verified only when the person types back a code Profile sent to them through the host's notifier (§15). Changing one makes it unverified again. Profile sends nothing else to them.

A change names only the attributes it changes: a value sets one, `null` removes it. An unknown attribute, an empty change or an attempt to set a verification claim is refused (`validation-failed`, with problem codes only, never the value).

## 4. Disclosure settings

The person chooses, for each attribute, its **audience**:

| Audience | Who sees it |
|---|---|
| `nobody` | The person only |
| `group` | People who share a group with them, both memberships in effect |
| `tenant` | Also anyone with a membership in effect in the same tenant |

The defaults are secure: `name` to `group`, everything else to `nobody`.

The person also chooses which name others see as their **display name**: `name`, `preferred_username` or `given_name` (default `name`). Others see it only if that attribute's audience includes them; otherwise they see the neutral fallback.

Finally, `anonymiseOnDeparture` (default `false`) shows the person as "Former member" in every group they leave, whatever the group's policy.

## 5. What a viewer sees

Identity's disclosure-context port says how the viewer is related to each person (`self`, `same-group`, `former-member`, `same-tenant`, `none`) and the person's standing (`visible`, `paused`, `suspended`, `closing`, `gone`). Profile then applies its rules, as the pure functions `discloseAttributes` and `discloseDisplayName`:

1. The person sees everything of their own, whatever their standing.
2. A `suspended`, `closing` or `gone` person is hidden from everyone else.
3. A `paused` person is hidden from listings (`purpose: 'listing'`: member lists, profiles, search), but stays attributed on past contributions (`purpose: 'attribution'`).
   With a group context, the subject's own membership of that group makes their standing stricter (`standingInGroup`): a member paused there counts as `paused` there, and one suspended there as `suspended`, as iam-integration's pausing and suspension process requires.
4. In an `administration` lookup (a group's member list as its administrators see it), a `suspended` fellow member of the group is shown by display name only, never other attributes, and only within the audience the person chose for that name, to a viewer who holds `profile.suspended-people:view` on the group now. Profile asks Authorisation through the access-decision port (§9), once per lookup and only when the answer could name someone. Otherwise it is a listing.
5. Otherwise each attribute is shown only to its audience: `same-group` reaches `group` and `tenant`; `same-tenant` reaches `tenant`; `none` reaches nothing.
6. A former member (§5.1) is shown by display name only, never by other attributes.

A display name is returned as a code, never as text the host must translate: `{ kind: 'name', value }`, `{ kind: 'pseudonym', number }`, `{ kind: 'former-member' }` or `{ kind: 'hidden' }`. Presentation localises them, for example "Former member 7", "Former member", "Member". A hidden answer is the same whether or not the person exists or has a record.

### 5.1 Departure data policy

When Identity announces `membership.ended`, Profile keeps how the leaver will be shown in that group ([joining and leaving](https://github.com/nuxt4-layers/iam-integration/blob/f2dcec8afd27bec5f0a40d73e652dc4644d6ad4c/docs/processes/joining-and-leaving.md)):

- the display name fellow members could see at that moment, encrypted with the leaver's key (null if they could see none);
- a pseudonym number, unique and stable within the group;
- nothing at all, if the person chose `anonymiseOnDeparture`.

A later lookup with that group as context applies the group's attribution, which Identity supplies: `keep-name` shows the kept name, `pseudonymise` shows "Former member N", `anonymise` shows "Former member". The leaver may at any time choose anonymity in a group (`anonymiseProfileDeparture`): the kept name and the pseudonym are deleted, whatever the group's policy.

## 6. Encryption and erasure

Every attribute value, and every kept departure name, is encrypted with the person's own 256-bit data key (AES-256-GCM, a fresh nonce for each value). The additional authenticated data binds each value to the identity and its purpose, so a ciphertext cannot be moved to another person or another column. Disclosure settings, identifiers, pseudonym numbers and codes are stored in the clear: none describes the person.

The data key is stored only **wrapped** by the host's `ProfileKeyWrapper`, which binds the identity to the wrapping and versions its wrapping key.

**Erasure** (anonymisation by unlinking, ADR-0005 §2.8) deletes the record, the departures and the wrapped key, and records the identifier as erased so that no record is created for it again. Domain records keep the identifier, which then refers to nobody. It happens when Identity announces `identity.closed`, or through `eraseProfile` with a reason code, and is announced as `profile.anonymised`.

**Backups.** A backup taken before erasure still holds the wrapped key. The host therefore rotates its wrapping key: `rewrapProfileKeys()` moves every live key to the current version, and `profileKeyVersionsInUse()` shows when no live key needs an old one. Once every backup taken under an old version has expired, or sooner, the host retires that version. An erased person's key is never re-wrapped, so their data in older backups becomes unreadable when the version it was wrapped with is retired. Backups never hold plaintext.

## 7. Errors

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `unauthenticated` | 401 | No signed-in subject |
| `forbidden` | 403 | Refused. Never says whether a person or record exists |
| `insufficient-assurance` | 403 | Needs a sign-in within the last 15 minutes (§12) |
| `validation-failed` | 400 | Malformed input; problem codes only |
| `conflict` | 409 | The record changed since the version the change was made against (`version-changed`) |
| `rate-limited` | 429 | The viewer's lookups for this window are spent |
| `unavailable` | 503 | Database, key port, subject resolver or Identity's port failure. Fails closed: no stale or partial answer |

## 8. Events

Written to Profile's transactional outbox in the same transaction as the change, and relayed by the host (`relayProfileOutbox`), at least once, in order.

| Event | Data |
|---|---|
| `profile.created` | `identityId` |
| `profile.changed` | `identityId`, the attribute names changed, whether disclosure changed |
| `profile.departure-anonymised` | `identityId`, `groupId`: drop any name cached for them there |
| `profile.anonymised` | `identityId`, `reasonCode`: drop every name cached for them |
| `profile.contact-verified` | `identityId`, `attribute` |
| `profile.request-opened` | `requestId`, `identityId`, `type`, `origin`, `parts`, `dueAt` (§14) |
| `profile.request-completed` | `requestId`, `identityId`, each part's `status` and `reasonCode` |
| `profile.request-escalated` | `requestId`, `identityId`, `reasonCode` (`due-soon`, `group-rename-overdue`): operators act |
| `profile.legal-hold-placed` | `holdId`, `identityId`, `parts`, `reasonCode`, `endsAt` |
| `profile.legal-hold-ended` | `holdId`, `identityId`, `parts`, `released` (no hold covers them any more), `identityClosed`, `reasonCode`: the host's handler erases the released parts of a closed identity |

Events carry identifiers, attribute names and codes only: never a value.

Profile consumes `identity.provisioned`, `membership.ended`, `identity.closed`, `identity.paused` and `group.renamed`, idempotently by event id; the last two complete parts of data-subject requests (§14). It reads pausing, suspension and closure from the disclosure-context port at each lookup instead, so a standing is never stale.

## 9. Ports

| Port | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ProfileDatabase` | Yes | PostgreSQL pool (runtime role), schema, and optionally the migration pool and the runtime role to grant |
| `ProfileKeyWrapper` | Yes | Wraps and unwraps each person's data key with a versioned host key (KMS, HSM, vault; `createLocalProfileKeyWrapper` for development) |
| `ProfileDisclosureContext` | Yes | Identity's disclosure-context port, read `bounded` |
| `ProfileSubjectResolver` | For the endpoints | The signed-in person for an HTTP request, from Authentication through the host |
| `ProfileRequestCoordinator` | For data-subject requests | Each other member's part of an access request (§14), from iam-integration's `profileRequestCoordinatorFromMembers`; a member's failure rejects that part only |
| `ProfileAccessDecision` | For `administration` lookups | Whether the viewer holds one of Profile's permissions on a group now, from iam-integration's `profileAccessDecisionFromAuthorisation` |
| `ProfileNotifier` | For verification | Delivers a verification code by email or SMS (§15); nothing else |

Profile's permission, for the host to add to Authorisation's catalogue (`PROFILE_PERMISSIONS`):

| Permission | Risk | Effect | Allows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `profile.suspended-people:view` | `high` | `view` | Seeing the display names of a group's suspended members, in an `administration` lookup. `high` because it discloses personal data otherwise hidden, so Authorisation's `*:view` wildcards never reach it: a host names it in the `owner` and `administrator` roles |

## 10. Server functions

| Function | Does |
|---|---|
| `migrateProfileDatabase()` | Applies migrations through the migration pool, granting the runtime role data access only |
| `getOwnProfile({ subjectId })` | The person's own record, settings and `version` (0 before anything is stored); null once erased |
| `updateProfile({ subjectId, changes, correlationId, expectedVersion? })` | §3; with `expectedVersion`, `conflict` if the record changed since |
| `setProfileDisclosure({ subjectId, settings, correlationId, expectedVersion? })` | §4; likewise |
| `anonymiseProfileDeparture({ subjectId, groupId, correlationId })` | §5.1 |
| `lookupProfileDisplayNames({ viewerId, subjectIds, groupId?, purpose })` | Up to 200 display names, in the order asked (§5) |
| `consumeProfileLookup({ viewerId })` | Counts one lookup against the rate limit (§12); `rate-limited` once spent |
| `viewProfile({ viewerId, subjectId, groupId? })` | One person's display name and disclosed attributes, as a listing |
| `exportProfileData({ subjectId })` | Profile's part of a data-subject export, decrypted |
| `applyProfileIdentityEvent(event)` | §8 |
| `eraseProfile({ identityId, reasonCode, correlationId })` | §6 |
| `rewrapProfileKeys({ limit? })`, `profileKeyVersionsInUse()` | Key rotation (§6) |
| `relayProfileOutbox({ publish, limit? })` | §8 |
| `listProfileDepartures({ subjectId })` | The groups the person has left: identifiers, dates and whether they chose anonymity there |
| `openProfileRequest({ subjectId, type, origin, reasonCode?, parts?, groupIds?, correlationId })` | Opens a request (§14) |
| `listProfileRequests({ subjectId })`, `getProfileRequest({ requestId })` | The person's requests; one request, for operators |
| `getProfileRequestArchive({ subjectId, requestId })` | A completed access request's archive, while it lasts |
| `settleProfileRequestPart({ requestId, part, outcome, reasonCode?, correlationId })` | An operator marks a part `done`, or `exempt` with a reason code |
| `recordProfileRequestPart({ identityId, part, correlationId })` | The host's handler reports Authentication's or Authorisation's erasure done |
| `placeProfileLegalHold(...)`, `releaseProfileLegalHold(...)`, `listProfileLegalHolds({ identityId })` | Legal holds (§14), for operators |
| `profileLegalHoldParts(identityId)` | The parts under hold now, for the host's closure handler |
| `runProfileMaintenance()` | Ends holds on their date, deletes expired archives, escalates requests, retries failed access parts, drops expired codes |
| `startProfileContactVerification(...)`, `confirmProfileContactVerification(...)` | §15 |

The operators' functions are server-only: a host never exposes them over HTTP.

The caller supplies `subjectId` and `viewerId` from the signed-in principal, never from a request body.

## 11. Versioning

This is contract version 1, provided by package 0.4. Before 1.0, breaking changes are listed here and in the release notes. Package 0.2 adds the HTTP API (§12), record versions, the `insufficient-assurance`, `conflict` and `rate-limited` codes and the subject-resolver port, without changing what version 0.1 provided. Package 0.3 adds the presentation (§13), without changing the contract. Package 0.4 adds data-subject requests and legal holds (§14), contact-detail verification (§15), the `administration` purpose, the membership's standing in the group context, Profile's permission and three optional ports. It changes one thing a client may rely on: `email_verified` and `phone_number_verified` may now be `true`.

## 12. HTTP API

Under `/api/profile`. Every endpoint takes the person or viewer only from the host's subject resolver (Authentication), never from the request; parses bodies with strict schemas; and answers errors as `ProfileErrorBody`: the code, a localisation key, and a problem code for `validation-failed` and `conflict` only. State-changing requests must carry an `Origin` (or `Referer`) matching `NUXT_PROFILE_BASE_URL`; without one configured, they are all refused.

| Endpoint | Does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /me` | The person's own record, settings and version | Signed in |
| `PATCH /me` | `{ expectedVersion, changes }` (§3) | A sign-in within 15 minutes if the change touches `email` or `phone_number` |
| `PUT /me/disclosure` | `{ expectedVersion, settings }` (§4) | Signed in |
| `POST /me/departures/:groupId/anonymise` | §5.1 | Signed in |
| `GET /me/export` | Profile's part of the person's export, `Cache-Control: no-store` | A sign-in within 15 minutes |
| `POST /display-names` | `{ subjectIds (≤ 200), groupId?, purpose }` (§5); `administration` needs `groupId` | Signed in; rate-limited |
| `GET /people/:subjectId?groupId=` | One person's display name and disclosed attributes, as a listing | Signed in; rate-limited |
| `GET /me/departures` | The groups the person has left (§10) | Signed in |
| `GET /me/requests` | The person's requests and each part's progress (§14) | Signed in |
| `POST /me/requests` | `{ type }`: an `access` or `restriction` request; 201 | A sign-in within 15 minutes |
| `GET /me/requests/:requestId/archive` | A completed access request's archive, `Cache-Control: no-store` | A sign-in within 15 minutes |
| `POST /me/verification/:attribute/send` | Sends a code to `email` or `phone_number` (§15) | A sign-in within 15 minutes; 5 an hour |
| `POST /me/verification/:attribute/confirm` | `{ code }` | Signed in |

A change sent against an older version than the one stored is refused with `conflict` (`version-changed`), so one tab cannot silently undo another's edit; the client reads `/me` again and retries.

Each viewer may make `PROFILE_LOOKUP_RATE_LIMIT` lookups (60 a minute, each up to 200 people) through the two lookup endpoints, counted in Profile's database. Host server code calling `lookupProfileDisplayNames` directly is not limited.

There is no erasure endpoint: erasure follows account closure (Identity's process), or an operator's `eraseProfile` on a verified request. The person can remove any attribute themselves.

`useProfile()` is the client side of this API, for the user experience only: it decides nothing. The default pages (§13) use it and nothing else.

Responses are never for another person than the one asked for: a hidden answer is the same whether or not the person exists.

## 13. Presentation

The layer registers default pages and `Profile*` components (`modules/presentation.ts`), which a host configures in its `nuxt.config.ts` under `profile`:

| Page | Default path | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| `profile` | `/profile` | The signed-in person's own profile: their details, who sees each, the name others see, their departure choice, and a download of their data |
| `person` | `/profile/people/:subjectId` | Another person's display name and the details they disclose to the viewer, now. `?groupId=` names the group in view, so a leaver is shown under its departure data policy |
| `departures` | `/profile/departures` | The groups the person has left, each named by `ProfileGroupName`, and the choice, after confirming, to be shown as "Former member" in one of them |
| `requests` | `/profile/requests` | The person's requests: a copy of all their data, or a restriction; each request's progress and the archive's download; deleting their data is closing the account, linked from `profile.routes.closeAccount` |

The own-profile page links to both, and offers verification for each saved contact detail.

**Group names.** Group names are Identity's. `ProfileGroupName` (prop `groupId`) reads "A group you left"; a host composing Identity backs it with a component of the same name that shows Identity's name for the group (`formerGroupNames` in Identity's own view of the person), so neither layer imports the other.

`profile: { pages: { paths: { ... } } }` moves the pages (the person path must keep `:subjectId`); `profile: { pages: { enabled: false } }` keeps the components without the pages; `profile: { presentation: false }` registers nothing. Every page is sent with `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `Cache-Control: no-store`, unless the host sets those headers itself. The person page's document title is always "Profile": a name never reaches the browser's history or tab list from it.

**What the pages decide: nothing.** They call `useProfile()` and show what the server answers; every change is decided again on the server. Fields are checked first with the contract's own `attributeSchemas`, so a problem is shown on its field; changes are sent against the version shown, and a `conflict` reloads the record. Contact-detail changes and the download ask for a recent sign-in when the server answers `insufficient-assurance`, with a link to sign in again. There is no erasure on any page (§12). An unknown person, one hidden from the viewer and a malformed identifier read alike: "This profile is not available to you."

**Names.** `ProfilePersonName` shows one person's name as Profile discloses it to the signed-in viewer:

| Prop | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `identityId` | — | Identity's identifier |
| `groupId` | `null` | The group the name is shown in, for the departure data policy |
| `purpose` | `listing` | `listing` leaves out a paused person; `attribution` keeps them named (§5) |
| `link` | `false` | Links a disclosed name to the person page, when that page is on. A fallback never links |

It renders "Member" on the server and until the answer arrives, and whenever Profile shows nothing, the same whether or not the person exists; "Former member N" and "Former member" come from the codes. Lookups go through `useProfileNames()`, in the browser only: every name a page asks for in one tick, for one group and purpose, is one request (up to 200 people) against the rate limit (§12); answers are kept for a minute and dropped by `forgetProfileNames()`, which a host calls when the viewer signs in or out. Identity's pages name people through `IdentityPersonName`; a host backs it with a component of that name that passes `identityId` and the group in view to `ProfilePersonName`, so neither layer imports the other.

**Text.** Every word comes from `presentation/messages.ts` (en-GB) through `useProfileText()`. Hosts change wording or add locales in `app.config.ts` under `profile.messages`, set the locale with `NUXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_LOCALE`, and point `profile.routes.signIn` (`NUXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ROUTES_SIGN_IN`) at their sign-in page, to which the pages link with `?redirect=`. Validation failures and conflicts are explained from the error's `reason` (`profile.reason.*`), otherwise from its code.

**Styling.** The pages style only through Theme Manager's SemanticPresentationTheme vocabulary (`profileClasses`), its public `presentation.css` and its size scales, never raw colours or Tailwind's default sizes; a host imports `@nuxt4-layers/profile/tailwind.css` after Theme Manager's stylesheet. Fill, Pen and Edge of one surface share role and state. The deliberate exceptions, the same as Identity's and Authentication's, which a host's theme must keep legible:

- `pen-muted-default` on `fill-base-default`: hints, notes and definition terms on the card;
- `edge-error-default` on `fill-input-default`: an invalid field's border;
- `edge-base-active` on `fill-base-default`: the keyboard focus indicator.

**Accessibility.** WCAG 2.2 AA: landmarks and one `h1` per page, labelled sections, fieldsets and fields, errors announced and focused (the first invalid field takes focus), status messages announced politely, keyboard operation throughout, 24-pixel targets, reflow at 320 CSS pixels. Browser tests (`tests/e2e/pages.spec.ts`) run axe's WCAG 2.2 AA rules and check non-text contrast with Theme Manager's real styles.

## 14. Data-subject requests and legal holds

Profile is the person's single point of contact for requests about their data ([iam-integration's process](https://github.com/nuxt4-layers/iam-integration/blob/91907176035bef4465cfe89c71b2dcd9353d2cc7/docs/processes/data-subject-requests.md)). It records each request and each member's part, and keeps legal holds; each member answers for what it holds.

| Type | Who opens it | Parts by default | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `access` | The person (recent sign-in) or an operator | `profile`, `identity`, `authentication`, `authorisation` | Profile's own part, then each other member's through the coordination port, one at a time; each bundle sealed with the person's key. Complete when every part is answered; the archive is downloadable by the person for 7 days, then deleted |
| `restriction` | The person (recent sign-in) or an operator | `profile` (and `identity` if named) | Every audience becomes `nobody` at once; Identity's part is done on `identity.paused` |
| `correction` | An operator | `profile` (and `identity` with `groupIds`) | Identity's part is done when every group named is renamed (`group.renamed`); raised to operators at half the deadline |
| `erasure` | An operator (the person closes their account) | `profile`, `identity`, `authentication`, `authorisation` | Done as closure completes: Identity's on `identity.closed` (and any renames), Profile's on its erasure, the others as the host's handler reports them (`recordProfileRequestPart`) |

A part is `pending`, `done`, `exempt` (with a reason code) or `held`; a request completes once every part is `done` or `exempt`. It is due one calendar month after opening (`PROFILE_REQUEST_POLICY`), and raised to operators (`profile.request-escalated`) 7 days before. Requests outlive an erasure, as identifiers, codes and times only.

**Legal holds** are placed and released by operators, with a reason code and an end date at most 7 years ahead. They cover any of `profile`, `authentication` and `authorisation`, and defer only those parts' erasure, never access, correction or restriction, and never Identity's closure:

- On `identity.closed`, a hold covering Profile keeps the record, readable by no function (`getOwnProfile` and `exportProfileData` answer null; changes are `forbidden`), and `eraseProfile` is refused (`conflict`, `legal-hold`).
- The host's closure handler reads `profileLegalHoldParts` and leaves the held parts of the other members alone.
- When a hold ends (released, or its end date in maintenance), `profile.legal-hold-ended` names the parts no hold covers any more; Profile erases a closed person's record if Profile's part is among them, and the host's handler erases the others.

## 15. Contact-detail verification

The person verifies a saved `email` or `phone_number`: Profile sends a 6-digit code through the host's notifier (email, or SMS for a telephone number), and the person types it back.

- Sending needs a sign-in within 15 minutes; 5 codes per detail an hour (`rate-limited`).
- A code lasts 10 minutes and allows 5 attempts; a wrong one is `validation-failed` (`wrong-code`), a spent, expired or unsent one `conflict` (`code-expired`).
- The code is kept only as an HMAC under the person's own data key, bound to the identity, the attribute and the value it was sent to: it verifies nothing else, and is destroyed with the key.
- A verified detail becomes unverified when it changes. `profile.contact-verified` carries the identity and the attribute name only.
- Profile sends nothing else to a contact detail.
